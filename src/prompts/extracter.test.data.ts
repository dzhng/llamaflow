  `{"content":["Bard provides accurate responses, but it’s overshadowed by one error in the demo. GPT-4, on the other hand, has been providing accurate responses since its release. No mistake has been reported until now. GPT-4 is available on the paid version for ChatGPT Plus, while Bard is only for a group of beta testers. Google Bard AI and ChatGPT-4 are the leading AI learning models. While the former is available for limited testers, the latter is for ChatGPT Plus paid subscribers. Both work on natural language processing with a transformative architecture. The most noticeable difference is that Bard is a language model focused on human-like conversations. Meanwhile, GPT-4 is a text and an image-based chatbot that comprehends users’ queries and responds to texts. Bard is integrated into Google’s search engine, while Microsoft Bing Chat uses GPT-4. Another difference is that Bard utilizes recent, real-time data from the web, but GPT-4 has a limited data source until 2021. On the table, GPT-4 is better than Bard, however there are more features left to discover about both platforms.","urls":[{"url":"https://history-computer.com/lamda-vs-chat-gpt-4/","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides more information about GPT-4 and its use in Microsoft Bing Chat."},{"url":"https://bard.google.com/","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides more information about Google Bard AI."},{"url":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/googles-bard-lags-behind-gpt-4-and-claude-in-head-to-head-comparison/","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides a comparison between Google Bard AI and GPT-4."},{"url":"https://zapier.com/blog/chatgpt-vs-bard/","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides a comparison between ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard AI."},{"url":"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Bard-vs-ChatGPT-Whats-the-difference","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides a comparison between Google Bard AI and ChatGPT-4."},{"url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-bard-vs-chatgpt-which-is-the-better-ai-chatbot/","description":"This URL is related to the content because it provides a comparison between Google Bard AI and ChatGPT-4."}]}`,
  `{"content":["Coffeehouses in Mecca, Yemen, and Cairo began to explode in popularity, and they become centers of public life within the sprawling cities of the Islamicate Empires. The coffeehouses sometimes acted like the bayt al-Hakima or madrasas, which were centers of Islamic life, arts, and thinking. Neha Verami, from the Folger Shakespeare Library, said that "the history of these coffeehouses offers three connected insights: the emergence of the public sphere, the participation of larger sections of the population in the political lives of the early modern Islamic empires, and the hollowness of the allegations of despotism mounted on ‘Oriental’ societies by Western onlookers". Coffee became an ingrained piece of Islamic culture for the centuries to come. Contrary to its role in recent centuries, coffee became a subject of debate for some. When the fatwa came into effect in 1532–1533, coffee and its consumption was established as haram. This decision most likely came from the idea that like alcohol, coffee had an effect on cognition, albeit different and milder. It is possible that the regulation was implemented in an attempt to limit consumption of other recreational substances such as tobacco and alcohol in the Ottoman and Safavid Empires. Drinking coffee in public places was also scorned. Not only was public consumption seen as taboo, but people would often drink from a communal bowl in a fashion similar to drinking wine. An effort was made to prevent the spread of coffee's growing popularity. While Suleiman I was still in power, taxes were imposed in an attempt to prevent both bureaucrats and those who were unemployed from consuming coffee. Further attempts occurred during both the reigns of Sultan Selim II in 1567 as well as Sultan Murad III in 1583 whenever those of more modest means began to drink coffee which included professions ranging from craftsmen to shopkeepers to local soldiers. Despite the attempt to bar people from drinking coffee, the fatwa ultimately failed as coffee did not compare to the effects of alcohol. That coffee was even seen as a mind-altering substance like alcohol meant that the prohibition was more of a misunderstanding of the substance or an attempt to control consumption based on Orthodox beliefs. This back-and-forth scenario falls within the debate of whether coffee is halal or haram. Within the Ottoman Empire, shops known as taḥmīskhāne in Ottoman Turkish were used to create coffee using the traditional method of roasting and crushing coffee beans in mortars. Coffee houses located in areas such as Mecca were visited by those from all over: Muslims from mosques, those coming from afar to trade and sell, or simple travelers making their way through. Despite the controversy over coffee, it was one of the keys to the economy around the Red Sea from the mid-15th century to the mid-17th century. Those of Islam were the primary consumers, ingraining it into the culture of the people within the Muslim faith. From Islam, the rest of the world would go on to experience something that holds influence over the world today. In the past, the Oromo tribe in Ethiopia created foods from coffee plants such as bunna qela, made of butter, salt, and roasted beans. Such a concoction would be used as a basis and altered over time. A more modern beverage known as qishr in Arabic is made of recycled dried cherry skins that would have normally been discarded after being used to create the beverage buna. These cherry skins would then be used to brew a sort of fruit tea. Qishr or cascara in Spanish is sold by coffee farmers even today.","urls":[{"url":"#cite_note-24","description":"This URL leads to a citation for the statement about coffeehouses in Mecca, Yemen, and Cairo becoming centers of public life within the sprawling cities of the Islamicate Empires."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom","description":"This URL leads to a page about the bayt al-Hakima or madrasas, which were centers of Islamic life, arts, and thinking, mentioned in the text."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folger_Shakespeare_Library","description":"This URL leads to a page about the Folger Shakespeare Library, which is the source of a quote by Neha Verami about the history of coffeehouses."},{"url":"#cite_note-25","description":"This URL leads to a citation for a quote by Neha Verami about the history of coffeehouses."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haram","description":"This URL leads to a page about the concept of haram, which is mentioned in the text as being associated with coffee consumption."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea","description":"This URL leads to a page about the Red Sea, which is mentioned in the text as being a key to the economy around the Red Sea from the mid-15th century to the mid-17th century."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafficho_people","description":"This URL leads to a page about the Kafficho people, who are mentioned in a legendary account of the origin of the consumption of coffee."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kaffa","description":"This URL leads to a page about the Kingdom of Kaffa, which is mentioned in a legendary account of the origin of the consumption of coffee."},{"url":"#cite_note-Wein34-1","description":"This URL leads to a citation for a legendary account of the origin of the consumption of coffee."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatherd","description":"This URL leads to a page about goatherds, which is mentioned in a legendary account of the origin of the consumption of coffee."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldi","description":"This URL leads to a page about Kaldi, who is mentioned in a legendary account of the origin of the consumption of coffee."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronite","description":"This URL leads to a page about the Maronite Church, which is mentioned in relation to a book by Faustus Nairon about coffee."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bunna_qela&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1","description":"This URL leads to a page about bunna qela, a food made from coffee plants by the Oromo tribe in Ethiopia."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qishr","description":"This URL leads to a page about qishr, a modern beverage made from recycled dried cherry skins that would have normally been discarded after being used to create the beverage buna."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascara_(drink)","description":"This URL leads to a page about cascara, a beverage made from the dried skins of coffee cherries that is sold by coffee farmers today."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_coffee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7","description":"This URL leads to an edit section for a section of the page about legendary accounts of the origin of the consumption of coffee."}]}`,
